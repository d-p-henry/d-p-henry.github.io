            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>
                The days of card catalogs are long gone, and navigating a technological environment that is constantly changing is something all fields must do. While I am familiar with quite a bit of technology, given my current position, where I have implemented software and hardware solutions to digital preservation problems, there were still many things that were new to me. I had not seen much of the institutional back-end: nitty-gritty vendor and database information. I also learned quite a bit on how technology serves different communities in different ways, and is often of lower quality and availability for rural, poor, and marginalized communities.<br><br>
                It is important to think about the ways in which technology affects communities in different ways. Libraries in America were formed in a culture of white supremacy, patriarchy, and elitism, and these roots run deep, in the way materials are cataloged, described, and presented. Furthermore, as systemic racism and oppression of marginalized communities continues to permeate the country, there is a very clear digital divide of technological access between more affluent, and more white communities, to poorer communities and communities with heavier BIPOC populations. This paper was a helpful exercise in looking at the ways technological access differs between these different communities. Realizing there is a problem, and realizing where the problem is and where it functions, is a crucial step to helping dismantle the oppressive systems and hierarchies that currently keep us in shackles.
