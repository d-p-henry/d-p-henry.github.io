    <p>Hello and welcome to my website!<br>
    I am entering the world of professional librarianship, and the purpose of this site is 
    to showcase my skills and experience. Here you will find: my curriculum vitae; samples of my work 
    to illustrate my core competencies; and reflections on what I’ve done, what I’ve learned; how 
    I’ve grown; and my goals for the future. Thank you for stopping by.</p>
