    <title>Welcome to Dillon Henry's Website</title>

Hi, my name is Dillon Henry. I'm a library student at the University of Missouri. I also works 
in a library as a  Digital Curation Fellow. I spend a lot of time copying data from removable media, like CDs 
and floppy disks. I have no previous web application or development experience. I expect this course
will give me a solid foundation in web development. From there, I hope it will be easy to advance
my skills. Maybe I'll design a website for myself! In my studies, I care about libraries and justice. I have 
written about difficulties some communities have with accessing library resources. 
This includes poorer people, minorities, and prisoners. I'm also interested in technology and 
libraries. Before studying library science, I studied music. I still enjoy writing songs in my spare 
time. I also love reading, cooking, hiking, and traveling.
