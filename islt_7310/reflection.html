        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <h3>Coursework</h3>
        <p>My coursework taught me a lot, and I didn’t realize how diverse librarianship really is. I have taken classes on a multitude of topics: from reference services to systems analysis, and from project management to technology and assessment. I have learned theoretical frameworks for approaching different challenges one can face in the profession. Libraries provide so many services to communities of varying types, and I now have a better idea of what these services are and how best to implement them.</p>
        <p class="reflections">
        Even though the degree is only four semesters, I have learned a lot and applied my knowledge in different ways. I have applied the core principles, ethics, values, and body of knowledge to questions in library and information science. Beyond that, I have applied management principles and interdisciplinary best practices in library and information agency environments. My studies have also helped me be able to assess community needs, formulate plans to respond to users of information agencies, and instruct users in using informational resources.
        </p>
        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p class="reflections">
        I am fortunate that I’ve also had years of hands-on experience working in a library. I have worked in three separate positions, where I have processed archival materials, provided metadata for photographs, and developed procedures for copying content from removable media. I have also interviewed senior staff to learn more about what they do, and how their work intersects to make the library run smoothly. I have developed a variety of skills and have discovered countless resources that will be helpful as I transition into a professional career. 
        </p>
        <h3>The Future</h3>
        <p class="reflections">
        I am not certain what my goals are for the future. I want a career in a library, but beyond that, I don’t feel a strong preference. I am comfortable in a university setting, so I am inclined to search for an academic librarian position. However, my studies have interested in me in helping traditionally marginalized communities, and a public library would likely be the best environment to do that. Additionally, since I have done research on libraries in carceral institutions, I think I would feel joy and purpose out of being a correctional librarian. The good news with this, is that I think no matter where I end up, I am confident I will be able to make a positive impact on a community, which will make me feel personally and professionally fulfilled.
