    <h1>About</h1>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am currently completing a master’s degree in Library and Information Science at the University 
        of Missouri—Columbia. Previously, I received a master’s degree in Music Composition from the 
        University of Michigan. I also have a bachelor’s degree in Music Composition from Carnegie 
        Mellon University. Since 2016, I have worked at LaBudde Special Collections & Archives at the 
        University of Missouri—Kansas City. Initially, I worked as an archival assistant. There, I 
        processed collections and created finding aids. After that, I worked briefly as a metadata 
        specialist: I added metadata to photographs for our digital collections. Currently, I’m a Digital 
        Curation Fellow. I am developing policies, procedures, and workflows for preserving digital content 
        on removable media, like CDs and floppy disks.</p>
