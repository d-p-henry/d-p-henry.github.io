            <p>
                What is a library if not a service institution? Librarians serve as stewards of knowledge and information, but this knowledge and information is only helpful insofar as it can be adequately provided to patrons and communities. Service involves a number of factors, and there is no catchall way to provide service, as individual institutions serve different communities with varying needs. The assignments below reflect my approach to evaluating community needs and providing the appropriate service for them.<br><br>
                The assignment I have chosen to show here comes from my Reference Sources and Services course, where I was required to create a LibGuide on the topic of my choosing. As a music student, it only felt natural to create a music LibGuide. This was an important exercise to me because, when I was an undergraduate student, I had poor research skills. Not only did I look for research materials poorly, I was not even sure where to look for materials. If I had been aware of LibGuides, that likely would have significantly improved my research skills. I took my previous music experience and combined it with the skills I developed in this course in locating and analyzing reference materials. It was helpful to think both as a student of music and as a librarian to determine how best to organize the guide in an intuitive, useful, and streamlined way.
