            This Student Learning Outcome (SLO) forms the core of the MLIS program. It is the learning outcome that around which all the other learning outcomes orbit. Learning the history and foundations of libraries and library science has been one of the more intriguing and enlightening aspects of this program. Every current idea and debate surrounding libraries and intellectual freedom has deep roots, and to understand where we are at the present, and what our possibilities are in the future, one must look toward the past.<br><br>
            The assignment here is one that was important to me. One of the issues I am most passionate about is prison justice, as the United States prison-industrial complex is a brutal system of exploitation and legalized slavery: the United States holds roughly 5% of the world's total population, but 25% of its prison population, with a large number of individuals incarcerated on non-violent drug offenses. Among the countless injustices incarcerated individuals face, is their unfair treatment with regards to access of information. With this paper, I went further in depth to see the levels of censorship prisoners are subject to, and the ways in which they are prohibited access to books, information, and services. These deprivations should be inexcusable to anyone who sees themselves as a proponent of libraries and intellectual freedom.
